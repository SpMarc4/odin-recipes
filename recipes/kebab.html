        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mash garlic into a paste with salt using a mortar and pestle or the flat side of a chef's knife on your cutting board.</li>
                <li>Mix garlic into lamb with onion, parsley, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, allspice, cayenne pepper, ginger, and pepper in a mixing bowl until well blended.</li>
                <li>Form mixture into 28 balls. Form each ball around the tip of a skewer, flattening it into a 2-inch oval; repeat with remaining skewers. Place kebabs onto a baking sheet, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 12 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Cook skewers on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 5 to 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a kebab should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
